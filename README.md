# EcoComet
*Your personal assistant for a sustainable life! Making UTD greener one step at a time!*

## Inspiration
Our app takes inspiration from the Forest app as well as an affinity to preserve and protect the environment around us.

## What it does
Our mobile app serves to help users develop sustainable habits by classifying images as recyclable/non recyclable. We also provide tips on how to have a more sustainable life, as well as places to recycle trash at UTD!

## How we built it
Our backend development team brilliantly trained a machine learning algorithm to classify trash as recyclable or nonrecyclable. This was done using Python.
The front end is built with Android Studio and Flutter, and utilizes many packages including the Google Maps API to show places near UTD to recycle.

## Challenges we ran into
The back-end's biggest challenges were training the machine learning algorithm to accurately define recyclable/non recyclable material. Another was with integration, as well as how to make the app user friendly and easy to use. 

## What's next for EcoComet
We would like to find better ways to encourage sustainability by creating a points system for the user to keep track of their recycling habits. Our goal is to make UTD a greener campus, one little habit at a time!
